# Get in loser, we're declaring our systems reproducibly.

## What is this?
It's my configs for my [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) installations.

## Why are they on Github?
It's convenient to have them version controlled and hosted somewhere. But more importantly: people need to know I'm one of the cool kids who use NixOS.

## What are the names?
They're the names of [the Plastics](https://meangirls.fandom.com/wiki/The_Plastics) from Tina Fey's hit 2004 movie *[Mean Girls](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377092/)*

## Why?
I was always jealous of people [who have cute names for their machines](https://xkcd.com/910/). For instance, Debian names their releases after [Toy Story characters](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ftparchives#sourceforcodenames), and 95% of the nerds who do this use Star Trek characters. So I figured this was a pretty unique naming scheme, and besides, it's a great movie.
